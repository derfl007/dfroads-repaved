**Road Signs**

Depending on your needs, there are simple and complex road signs.

Simple road signs give you the option to change the size and texture you want to use. These could be something like a speed limit sign, or a warning sign.
They also come in LED variants for added visibilty at night. You can even turn them on and off with redstone!

Complex ones feature a fully featured editor with movable and resizable icons, text, and more. Create your own signs and save them as presets for later. Think of them like completely customizable highway signs!

**Road Blocks**

Road blocks come in 5 variants: Full Block, Slab, Full Slope, Top Half Slope and Bottom Half Slope. With these five variants, the possibilities for custom roads are endless!

If you've played the previous version of this mod, you might also be wondering where all the textures, so let me introduce: _The road painter!_
With the road painter, you can now simply place blocks and paint them with over 20 different textures and 16 colors afterwards.

**Traffic Lights**

Traffic lights are no longer simple animated models, they now feature a customizable editor, which allows you to add any combination of traffic light phases and switch between them with redstone pulses. The amount of pulses to switch between phases is configurable, making them easily controllable with a simple redstone clock if needed!

**Sign Posts**

Sign posts might not seem too exciting at first, but actually have more features than you would think! They can dynamically connect to blocks, signs, traffic lights, and more and will even transmit redstone, making it easy to power LED signs, street lamps and traffic lights!  
Further enhancements like built-in power sources, sensors and timers are also planned for the future, making them even more versatile.

**Other decorative blocks**

In addition to the main attractions of this mod, there are several other blocks which will make your roads look as realistic as ever. Bollards, Traffic cones, Guard Rails, etc. These don't have any special features, so just pick them up and place them wherever you see fit.
